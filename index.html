                        React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Learn what React is all about on our
                        homepage or in the tutorial.

                    <p>
                        React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as
                        much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a
                        simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you
                        get started.
                    </p>

                        React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as
                        much React as you need. Perhaps you only want to add some “sprinkles of interactivity” to an
                        existing page. React components are a great way to do that.
                        <br><br>
                        The majority of websites aren`t, and don`t need to be, single-page apps. With a few lines of
                        code and no build tooling, try React in a small part of your website. You can then either
                        gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.

                        In this section, we will show how to add a React component to an existing HTML page. You can
                        follow along with your own website, or create an empty HTML file to practice.
                        <br><br>
                        There will be no complicated tools or install requirements — to complete this section, you only
                        need an internet connection, and a minute of your time.

                    <p><span class="title">Step 1: Add a DOM Container to the HTML</span></p>
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        < !- - ... existing HTML ... -->
                        <br>
                        < div id="like_button_container">< /div >
                        <br>
                        < !-- ... existing HTML ... -->
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        We gave this
                        < div> a unique id HTML attribute. This will allow us to find it from the JavaScript code later
                            and
                            display a React component inside of it.
                    </p>

                    <p><span class="title">Step 2: Add the Script Tags</span></p>
                    <p>
                        Next, add three script tags to the HTML page right before the closing body tag :

                        <code>
                             script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin> / script 
                             script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin> /script     
                             <br>
                             load our React Component
                             <br>
                              script src="like_button.js"> /script>
                        </code>
                        <br>
                        The first two tags load React. The third one will load your component code.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class="title">Step 3: Create a React Component</span></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Create a file called like_button.js next to your HTML page.
                        <br><br>
                        Open this <a href="#starter">starter code</a> and paste it into the file you created.
                        <br><br>
                        After <a href="#after">the starter code</a>, add two lines to the bottom of like_button.js:
                        <br>
                        <code>
                            //.... the starter code you pasted ....
                        <br>
                        const domContainer = document.querySelector('#like_button_container');
                        <br>ReactDOM.render(e(LikeButton), domContainer);
                        </code>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class="title">That's it</span></p>
                    <p>
                        There is no step four. You have just added the first React component to your website.

                        <li>Scaling to many files and components.</li>

                        <h2>Rendering Elements</h2>

                    <p>
                        An element describes what you want to see on the screen:
                        <br>
                        <code>
                            const element = < h1 Hello, world /h1>;
                        </code>
                        <br>
                        Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React
                        DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="title">Rendering an Element into the DOM</span></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Let's say there is a < div> somewhere in your HTML file:
                            <br>
                            <code>
                                < div id="root">< /div >
                        </code>
                            We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.
                            <br><br>
                            Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are
                            integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you
                            like.
                            <br><br>
                            To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():
                            <code>
                            const element = < h1>Hello, world< /h1>;
                            <br>
                            ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));

                        </code>
                    </p>
